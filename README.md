## Note for TerarkDB
To compile this fork of RocksDB, you need to clone [terark-zip-rocksdb](https://github.com/terark/terark-zip-rocksdb) and add `terark-zip-rocksdb/src` to include path, but `libterark-zip-rocksdb` is not need for compiling. -- The simplest way is to put this repository and [terark-zip-rocksdb](https://github.com/terark/terark-zip-rocksdb) in a same directory, and do nothing for include path(already added at [Makefile](Makefile#L15)).

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team.
It is built on earlier work on LevelDB by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it specially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.

See the [github wiki](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki) for more explanation.

The public interface is in `include/`.  Callers should not include or
rely on the details of any other header files in this package.  Those
internal APIs may be changed without warning.
